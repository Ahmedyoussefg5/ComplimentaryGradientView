  /// `elements.count`.
  /// Almost by convention, if `taking` is 0, the function will return [[]] (an array with only one possible permutation
  /// - a permutation with no elements). In a different scenario, if `taking` is bigger than `elements.count` the function
  /// will return [] (an empty array, so including no permutation at all).

  ///   - elements: Array to be permutating.
  ///   - taking: Picking item count from array.
  /// - Returns: Returns permutations of elements without repetition.
